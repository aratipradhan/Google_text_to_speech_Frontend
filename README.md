 Project Completed: Text-to-Speech Converter using Python ðŸŽ¤

I'm excited to share my latest project, a Text-to-Speech Converter built using Python, gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), and Streamlit for the frontend! This app allows users to easily convert any text into audio.
ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
Seamless text input and language selection interface.
Converts text into high-quality speech using Googleâ€™s TTS API.
Audio playback directly in the browser.
Clean and responsive user interface using Streamlit.
Background customization for a personalized experience.
This project showcases my skills in Python, web-based app development with Streamlit, and API integration for real-time functionalities. Looking forward to applying these techniques in more advanced projects!
